Greetings ladies and gentlemen,

Our good friend Hecthor Doomhammer welcomes you all to the first ever Hecthor Doomhammer Red Alert 1vs1 Tournament!

A Tournament unlike any other where contestants are subjected to a new challenge each round to keep them out of their comfort zone and constantly on their toes.

Starting July 2nd at 10:00am GMT/12:00pm CEST a field of 16 challengers will be waging a two-weekend war to decide who will take the honor, glory and the prize money on July 10th.

The prize pool currently consists of a whopping &euro;160 and will be scaled according to the number of signups. In the case of only eight to twelve contestants signing up it will be decreased to &euro;100, should there be seven or less to &euro;60.

The complete tournament will be hosted and livestreamed from [Hecthor Doomhammer's Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/pauljongejans). Joining him will be his fellow casters SoScared and FiveAces as well as well-known community figures Jazz_KCS and Ripsn as tournament officials.

To register visit the [Tournament thread on Sleipnir's Forum](https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?t=19594). You will also find all about the specific tournament rules in that thread. Registrations will close on June 26th, so hurry hup!
