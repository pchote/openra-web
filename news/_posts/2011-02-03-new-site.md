Welcome to the new OpenRA website. It looks much like the old one but you might notice a few changes, the most noticeable being the news list. We're using an Open-Source Content Management System called [SilverStripe](http://silverstripe.org/) which allows us to easily keep you up to date with news and extend the site with new interactive content.

In the coming weeks, we will be implementing a map repository, allowing map makers to upload their maps for easy distribution. A mod repository for doing much the same with mods and finally a master server browser allowing you to see who's playing without having to launch the game.
