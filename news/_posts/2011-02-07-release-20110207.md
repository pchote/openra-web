Another month has passed, which means that it's time for another mega OpenRA release!
This release sees several large changes to our underlying game engine which have allowed us to introduce some awesome new game features.

The highlights of this release are:

* 5 infantry per cell!
* The platform specific launchers have been replaced with an ingame package downloader and mod switcher
* Scatter command (bound to the 'x' key)
* "Pop up" SAM sites in cnc
* 3 new maps, by our IRC regulars nudalz and [Arcturus]
* Many bug and desync fixes

The full user-friendly changelog can be found [on the forum](http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14844), or by viewing the [commit log on github](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/commits/release-20110207).
