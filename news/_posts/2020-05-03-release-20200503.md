We are pleased to finally announce [Release 20200503]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}), which brings the public release up to date with development changes from September 2019 through to March 2020. Two months of public playtesting have allowed us to polish these changes into the release today.

The new release adds some long-awaited UI improvements, core engine upgrades, and a few balance changes for the multiplayer community.

Once again, FiveAces has put together a patch spotlight video that explains many of these changes:
