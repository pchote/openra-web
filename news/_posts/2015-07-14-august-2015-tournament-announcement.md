Attention all OpenRA players! There is another tournament coming up, once again organized by Ripley!

There will be three games of FFA in pairs running sometime in the middle of August and there will be one final match between the winners of their respective brackets. You must [sign up](https://compo.openra.net/) if you'd like to compete in this tournament so that Ripley may organize the brackets based on your timezones.

For those who would rather watch; there will be several casters who will be covering the games. They will be listed when the tournament arrives.
