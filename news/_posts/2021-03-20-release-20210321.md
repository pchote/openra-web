Today is the day that many have been waiting for: the new stable OpenRA [Release 20210321]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) is now available!

We had originally planned to announce this release with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJbJ_UtmkDaL4cClS2QYd3uXueES4KEq">patch spotlight</a> video, but an unfortunately timed computer failure has left FiveAces' battlefield control offline until repairs are completed. Rather than continue to delay the release, we have commissioned our best artist to make the placeholder image below and will post the real spotlight once it is available.

Many of the biggest changes in this release were focused around the in-development Tiberian Sun mod, which continues to make slow progress in our development repository. There are many great changes for Red Alert, Tiberian Dawn, and Dune 2000 too, focusing mainly around streamlining some awkward gameplay mechanics, improving community integration, and improving our singleplayer content:

 * Support for Discord integration and community-run ladders
 * New lobby features for setting player handicaps and disabling spawn points
 * Refreshed map selection and community balance changes for Red Alert and Tiberian Dawn
 * Further adjustments to make Dune 2000 gameplay more faithful to the original game
 * More fluid infantry combat after fixing several long-standing combat bugs
 * A further 9 campaign missions for Red Alert and improvements
 * Improved AI behaviour and performance

These features and more will be explained in more detail in the upcoming release spotlight, but for now you can look back over the previous news posts [[1]({{ '/news/devblog-20200629/' | relative_url }}), [2]({{ '/news/playtest-20201213/' | relative_url }}), [3]({{ '/news/playtest-20210131/' | relative_url }})] or the [full changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog) for more information.

Meanwhile, after several months work
<a href="https://github.com/Fauntleroy">@Fauntleroy</a> a brand new website design. In addition to the fresh look, the [live games list]({{ '/games' | relative_url }}) has been upgraded with map previews and player lists in the server tooltips. We will continue to iterate on the new design, so let us know if you find something that doesn't look right.
