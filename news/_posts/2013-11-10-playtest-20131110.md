**Note: The 1110 playtest contained issues under Windows and Debian/Ubuntu.**<br />
**These have been resolved in the 1112 build.**

We have just released a new playtest build containing the latest snapshot of our development progress.
Playtest-20131112 can be downloaded from the [download page]({{ '/download' | relative_url }}) or using your git client.
If you run into any issues or have any feedback then you can create a ticket on our [Github issue tracker](http://bugs.open-ra.org) or [find us on IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openra).

Some of the key changes from our [stable september release](http://openra.res0l.net/news/release-20130915/) include:

   - Added support for multiple languages (translations for DE, FR, ES, RU and PL are in progress).
   - Added support for password-protected servers and a global lobby chat channel.
   - Additional UI polishing, including a new settings menu, overhauled chat, and improved hotkey support.
   - Improvements to RA include production acceleration, the base radius from C&C, and the M.A.D Tank!
   - An overhauled Airstrike and improved weapon effects for C&C (now renamed to Tiberian Dawn).
   - The popular RA map Haos Ridges is now available in Tiberian Dawn.

As usual, the [changelog](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/playtest-20131112/CHANGELOG) contains all the details, including a list of changes that affect maps and mods.

![Settings]({{ '/images/news/20131102-settings.png' | relative_url }})

The new settings menu provides improved access to the important settings, and is unified across all the mods.

![MAD tank]({{ '/images/news/20131102-qtnk.png' | relative_url }})

The M.A.D Tank detonates a powerful seismic blast that heavily damages vehicles and structures.

![A10 airstrike]({{ '/images/news/20131102-a10-strike.png' | relative_url }})

The new Airstrike power calls a group of A10 to strike an area with gatling guns and napalm bombs.

![Haos Ridges C&C]({{ '/images/news/20131102-haos-ridges-cnc.png' | relative_url }})

Haos Ridges is now available in C&C (thanks sunny!).

Our friends at [Project Perfect Mod](http://www.ppmsite.com/) have created a new [OpenRA Editing Forums](http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/index.php?f=929) section where modders can compare notes with each other.
We will be keeping an eye on these as well as our [official forum](http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=80) (which is currently offline due to a hardware failure).
