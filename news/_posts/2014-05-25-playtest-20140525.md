We have just released [playtest-20140525](/download/), which is the first release candidate for our upcoming June release.

The focus of this playtest has been improving our low-level engine code, but there have been a few nice player-facing
improvements, too:

- Fixed the shellmap issues that were present in the previous playtest.
- Added a "Battlefield News" indicator, so we can keep you up to date on with the latest community news.
- Further improvements to the lobby and replay interfaces.
- Significant reductions in load time.
- More balance improvements!
- More bug fixes!

The full list of changes compared with [holiday release](/news/release-20131223/) is available [on our wiki](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Changelog).

This announcement is briefer than usual: as the final release only a couple of weeks away, we have decided to save the
usual set of screenshots and details for the proper release announcement.
