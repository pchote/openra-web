Our latest release includes changes and new features that implement several popular requests, including:

* Support for installing assets from an English "The First Decade" DVD.
* Adding the ability to view the map after a match completes.
* Adding a notification when a game admin selects a map with custom rules.
* Recording replays for single player missions.
* Removing the "Enemy Detected" warnings from RA and D2K.
* Fixing bottlenecks in the AI and harvesters to dramatically improve late-game performance.

Other notable changes include:

* Completely overhauled in-game music behaviour (don't forget to install the music from Extras &rarr; Music!).
* Capture screenshots (saved to the support directory) using Ctrl/Cmd+P.
* Units will no longer pursue enemies after they disappear under the fog of war.
* Improved aircraft and paradrop behaviour in RA.
* Added missions Atreides01a and Atreides01b and FMV installation to D2K.

As usual, this is only a small sampling of the [full changelog](http://changelog.openra.net) that is available on our wiki.

Once again we hope youâ€™ll enjoy this newest installment of OpenRA!

We know that many people are excited about our in-development Tiberian Sun mod, and we're pleased to report that we have made significant progress during this release cycle.  The core engine changes to support the 2.5D isometric maps used by TS and RA2 are now complete, and we are making slow-but-forward progress on implementing the many missing gameplay features for TS.  There is still a lot of work to go, so we do not have a formal release schedule for these mods.
