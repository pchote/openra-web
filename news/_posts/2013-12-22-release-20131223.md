<p>Our hard working developer-elves have wrapped up a new release as an early christmas present to our fans.<br />
We have focused on two main areas in this version: improving the stability and polish of our existing mods, and laying
the foundations for several big new features that will appear in future releases.</p>

<p markdown="1">In the last three months we have merged 769 commits by 14 authors into [our Github project](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA).<br />
We do all of our development in the open, so anybody can get involved!<br />
You can find us on [our IRC channel](irc://chat.freenode.net/openra) ([webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=openra)) or using your favorite social media platform:</p>

Some important improvements over our last [September release]({{ '/news/release-20130915/' | relative_url }}) are:

   - We now support [Lua scripting](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Map-scripting) in maps for creating missions and custom minigames.
   - Our Red Alert mod now includes the M.A.D tank, production acceleration (multiple factories improve the production rate), and the heavily requested base-size limit from our TD mod.
   - Our Tiberian Dawn mod (renamed from C&C) has overhauled support powers and weapon effects.
   - Our Dune 2000 mod now uses the original artwork for shroud and spice.
   - Menu UI improvements include password-protected servers and a new unified settings menu.
   - A lot more bug, polish, and performance fixes. Thanks to everyone who [reported problems](http://bugs.open-ra.org)!
